# Blood vessels segmentation in eye image through image processing

A number of image processing techniques have been applied to extract the blood vessels from the fundus image of the eye. Some of the techniques
applied are histogram equalisation, CHALE image formation, thresholding, binarization. 
The resultant image is a well segmented image of blood vessels
